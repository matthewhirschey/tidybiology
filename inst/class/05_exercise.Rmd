## Analysing the Golub dataset `r fa("dna")`

### Background
These data was obtained from the package [multtest](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/multtest.html), which is a Biconductor package that offers tools for multiple testing procedures. The "Golub dataset" refers to data used in [Golub et al. (1999)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10521349/). This was a landmark paper that described the use of genome-wide expression to predict disease status (specifically, acute myeloid lukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic lukemia (ALL). This is a rich dataset that is useful for practising everything from [data viz to machine learning](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/gene-expression).  

## Making a Volcano Plot `r fa("mountain")`

To begin, let's first look at the dataframes we have here

```{r glimpse, results="hide"}
glimpse(golub_subjects)
glimpse(gene_pval)
```

We first need to join the two dataframes - `golub_subjects` and `gene_pval`.  

```{r inner-join}
golub_full <- golub_subjects %>% 
                inner_join(gene_pval, by = "gene_name")
```

Before proceeding, let's first remove all rows that contain "AFFX" in the `gene_name` column.  

```{r stringr}
golub_full <- golub_full %>% 
               filter(!str_detect(gene_name, "AFFX"))
```

Then calculate the negative log 10 p-values and log fold-change

```{r p-val-fc}
golub_full <- golub_full %>% 
                mutate(neg_log_pval = -log10(p_val_adj)) %>% 
                mutate(log_fc = mean_ALL - mean_AML) 
```


Make the volcano plots!

```{r volcano, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(golub_full, aes(log_fc, neg_log_pval)) +
   geom_point(data = filter(golub_full, neg_log_pval > -log10(0.05), log_fc > log10(2)|log_fc < -log10(2)), colour = "blue", shape = 21, size = 1) +  
  geom_point(data = filter(golub_full, neg_log_pval <= -log10(0.05)), colour = "black", size = 1) + 
  geom_point(data = filter(golub_full, log_fc <= log10(2), log_fc >= -log10(2)), colour = "black", size = 1) + 
  geom_text_repel(data = filter(golub_full, log_fc == max(log_fc)), aes(label = word(gene_name)[1])) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = log10(2), linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -log10(2), linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), linetype = "dotted", colour = "red") +
  labs(x = "Log Fold-Change",
       y = "Negative log10 Adjusted p-value",
       title = "Volcano plot for Golub dataset",
       subtitle = "Comparing mean log10 expression values for ALL vs. AML",
       caption = "Data Source: multtest R package") +
  theme_bw() 
```

Volcano plot code explained
```{r volcano-explained, eval = FALSE}
# Plot log_fc against neg_log_pval
ggplot(golub_full, aes(log_fc, neg_log_pval)) +
  # Highlight significantly different genes that are also above abs(log10(2)) threshold using blue circles
   geom_point(data = filter(golub_full, neg_log_pval > -log10(0.05), log_fc > log10(2)|log_fc < -log10(2)), colour = "blue", shape = 21, size = 1) +  
  # Make all other points black dots
  geom_point(data = filter(golub_full, neg_log_pval <= -log10(0.05)), colour = "black", size = 1) + 
  geom_point(data = filter(golub_full, log_fc <= log10(2), log_fc >= -log10(2)), colour = "black", size = 1) + 
  # Label the gene with the maximum log_fc value, and clean up the name (the original is very long)
  geom_text_repel(data = filter(golub_full, log_fc == max(log_fc)), aes(label = word(gene_name)[1])) +
  # Highlight the y-axis using a solid black line
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0) +
  # Draw a red dashed line to show positive log_fc threshold (arbitrarily chosen value)
  geom_vline(xintercept = log10(2), linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +
  # Draw a red dashed line to show negative log_fc threshold (arbitrarily chosen value)
  geom_vline(xintercept = -log10(2), linetype = "dashed", colour = "red") +
  # Draw a red dotted line to show neg_log_pval threshold threshold (arbitrarily chosen value)
  geom_hline(yintercept = -log10(0.05), linetype = "dotted", colour = "red") +
  # Add text labels
  labs(x = "Log Fold-Change",
       y = "Negative log10 Adjusted p-value",
       title = "Volcano plot for Golub dataset",
       subtitle = "Comparing mean log10 expression values for ALL vs. AML",

  # Change theme to make a cleaner plot

## Understanding chunk options `r fa("r-project")`

So far, we've asked you to ignore these `{r volcano-explained, eval = FALSE}` code chunks. Now, we'll take a look at what these lines can do. 

The first element in the code chunk options is `r`, which defines the programming language the chunk is to be executed in.

The second element is the code chunk label. This label is optional but it needs to be unique, R will throw an error if you try to knit two chunks with the same label.

```{r label}
print("Hello")
```

Exercise: Edit the code chunk options below to remove the error.

```{r label1}
print("Hello again")
```

We will now look at a few options for customizing the output.

### `eval`

By default, every chunk in a markdown file is run whenever you knit a document. If you want to keep a chunk but not run it, set `eval` to `FALSE`

```{r no_eval, eval=FALSE}
# this code chunk will not be evaluated - useful when you want to keep old code for posterity but not execute it
print(old_var)
# the variable old_var does not exist but this will not give an error
```

### `echo`

By default, every chunk in a markdown file is printed when you knit a document. If you want to run a code chunk but not show the code, set `echo` to `FALSE`

```{r no_echo, echo=FALSE}
print("The code that printed this line is not visible")
```


### `results`

By default, the output for every chunk is printed when you knit a document. If you want to run a code chunk but not show the output, set `results` to `"hide"`

```{r no_results, results="hide"}
# the code chunk will be run but the output for this code chunk will be hidden.
new_var = 1
```

```{r no_results1}
# results="hide" differs from eval=FALSE
print(paste("The value of the variable new_var is", new_var))
```


### `message`

By default, the info messages for every chunk is printed when you knit a document. If you want to run a code chunk but not show the info messages, set `message` to `FALSE`

```{r no_messages, message=TRUE}
# the code chunk will be run but the info messages for this code chunk will be hidden if message=FALSE
install.packages("devtools", force=TRUE)
```

### `include`

If you want to run a code chunk but show neither the code nor the output, set `include` to `FALSE`. This is useful for installing packages and other background tasks.

```{r no_include, include=TRUE}
# the code chunk will be run but the everything for this code chunk will be hidden if include=FALSE
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("devangthakkar/scRNAseq", force=TRUE)
library(scRNAseq)
```
